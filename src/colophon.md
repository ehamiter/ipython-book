# Colophon

<span class="smallcaps">The body text</span> of *IPython for Web Devs* is set in [Gentium Book Basic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gentium+Basic), which was designed by Victor Gaultney. The Gentium Book Basic font family is based on the original Gentium design, but with additional weights. The family comes with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts.

<span class="smallcaps">The side chapter text</span> is set in [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), a humanist sans serif typeface which was designed by Steve Matteson. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

<span class="smallcaps">The monospaced font</span> used for code samples is [Edlo](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo), which I created by modifying a version of Stephen G. Hartke's [Aurulent Sans](https://www.dafont.com/aurulent-sans-mono.font), which I thought was beautiful, but hazardous for programming because the similarities between zeroes and ohs and ones and els were too close for comfort.

<span class="smallcaps">The book cover</span> was illustrated by [lutfihakim394](https://www.fiverr.com/lutfihakim394).

<span class="smallcaps">The favicon</span> snake graphic was created by [Bakunetsu Kaito](https://thenounproject.com/term/snake/1190118) from the Noun Project.

<span class="smallcaps">This book</span> was generated by using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), which is a free, open source command line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown (as by the CommonMark specification) files. It's very similar to Gitbook but written in Rust.
