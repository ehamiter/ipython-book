# InteractiveShellApp.banner1

<pre class="output">
## The part of the banner to be printed before the profile
#  Default: "Python 3.8.2 (default, Jul  5 2020, 15:01:50) \nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\nIPython 7.18.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\n"

You can customize the banner that is displayed on startup-- if you're the kind of person who's into that kind of thing. You could cut it down to the important bits if you *are* into the whole brevity thing:
```
c.InteractiveShell.banner1 = "Python 3.8.2 -- IPython 7.18.1\n"
```
â€¦or eliminate it entirely:
```
c.TerminalIPythonApp.display_banner = False
```
